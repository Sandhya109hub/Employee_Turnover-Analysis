# Employee_Turnover-Analysis
Explore the dynamics of employee turnover within an organization using Python and Jupyter notebooks. Utilize HR data to analyze turnover rates, examine patterns across different departments, and identify potential factors contributing to employee exits. Incorporate data visualization techniques to present key findings, and if available, analyze exit interview data to gain deeper insights into the reasons behind employee turnover. This project encompasses data cleaning, statistical analysis, and the development of actionable recommendations for employee retention.
